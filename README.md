A 2.5D single screen platformer made for the 1st and 2nd module for my masters course.
We were a team of 3 programmers, 3 artists and 3 designers. 
We used mainly Cocos2d with C++.

A few of the key features I worked on are:

1. A Menu System
2. Audio Manager
3. Cut scenes with ticker text
4. A Time-based Level
5. Saving and Loading Game using Data Persistence 
6. A Shooting Robotic Enemy
7. Tutorials Pop up
